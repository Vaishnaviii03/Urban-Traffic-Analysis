## üìë Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing urban traffic density across various cities. Using data from the Kaggle dataset ["Urban Traffic Density in Cities"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanishqdublish/urban-traffic-density-in-cities), the goal is to gain insights into traffic patterns, identify peak hours, and explore factors that contribute to traffic congestion.

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

- **TRAFFIC ANALYSIS.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the data analysis steps, including data loading, preprocessing, visualization, and insights.
- **data/**: Folder containing the dataset used in the analysis.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle, consisting of traffic density data across various cities. It includes multiple features such as city name, date, time, and traffic density levels, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of urban traffic patterns.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vaishnaviii03/urban-traffic-density-analysis.git
   cd urban-traffic-density-analysis
``
2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
``
4. Open `TRAFFIC ANALYSIS.ipynb` to explore the analysis.

## üîç Key Analysis Steps

### Data Preprocessing:
- Handled missing values.
- Converted data types for efficient analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualized traffic density trends over time.
- Identified peak traffic hours and high-density areas.

### Correlation Analysis:
- Analyzed correlations between different features to understand relationships affecting traffic density.

### Visualization:
- Used various plots like line charts, heatmaps, and bar graphs to represent traffic patterns visually.

## üåü Insights

- **Peak Traffic Hours**: Identified times of the day when traffic density is at its highest.
- **City Comparisons**: Compared traffic patterns across different cities.
- **Traffic Trends**: Analyzed trends over days, weeks, and months to determine consistent traffic patterns.
